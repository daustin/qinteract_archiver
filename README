Qinteract Archiver

Saves qinteract projects on a staging location, writing meta information in README.json
then 7-zips and downloads then to another machine

The client then checks the download and picks a volume to store
The client updates the README.json with disk ID
The client uploads the README.json to iarchive:

http://github.com/itmat/iarchive

Includes client-side verifying scripts that will get the files from qinteract, 
and verify that they are all in the storage space, and that the file sizes are the same

ONE CAVEAT is that mysql server has to allow larger packets than default:
